#Experiences for training
1. setting base_lr = 0.0001, the loss are bounce up and down from 1 to 0.7 to 2,.., after iter = 400, loss = 87!
   -> loss's up and down may be because learning rate are too high, setting them from lr = 1e-5, and see.
   
2. TypeError:'Module is not callable' 
   -> check whether you from datasets.unbc import unbc, and in the main function, you write datasets.unbc(wrong), should write: xx=unbc()

3. AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'text_format'
   -> solve:adding 'import google.protobuf.text_format'
4. On csc: Be ATTENTION of copying files to csc, because the path are different.

Omitting computing bounding-box regression targets...
srun: error: g99: task 0: Aborted (core dumped)
srun: Terminating job step 37729598.0
-> This is becasue your solver.prototxt file which assign the path of train.prototxt are with wrong path. Change it to the path on csc.
